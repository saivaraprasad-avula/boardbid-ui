    websiteCopy: `Airports are among the most premium advertising environments in the world, offering long dwell times and repeated exposure across a traveler’s journey. From check-in counters and TSA lines to gate concourses, lounges, and baggage claims, airport advertising reaches business professionals, international tourists, and affluent families at moments when they are highly attentive.
Airports are located in every major U.S. market and international gateway. Large digital walls, interactive kiosks, baggage claim displays, and airline lounge screens each provide multiple touchpoints. The average traveler spends 1–3 hours inside an airport, making it one of the most effective OOH environments for recall.
Airports are best suited for luxury goods, travel and hospitality, financial services, tech, B2B enterprise, and CPG brands. Examples: a luggage brand dominating baggage claim, a credit card brand in premium lounges, or a ski resort geo-targeting flights leaving Miami. Creative can be dayparted to departure/arrival waves or dynamically updated based on weather and delays.`,

Travelers spend hours inside terminals, lounges, and baggage claims — times when they are focused, aspirational, and open to new ideas.
